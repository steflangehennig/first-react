Afghanistan: Background and U.S. Policy 

In 2021, U.S. and international forces withdrew from Afghanistan after nearly two decades of 
operations, and the Taliban, a Sunni Islamist extremist group that formerly ruled the country 
from 1996 to 2001, retook power. The United States does not recognize the Taliban or any other 
entity as the government of Afghanistan and reports there are no U.S. diplomatic or military 
personnel in the country. The Taliban’s rule appears to have had negative effects for many 
Afghans, as well as a number of U.S. policy interests.

Specialist in Middle 
Eastern Affairs 

The Taliban government is dominated by officials from the Taliban’s prior rule or longtime 
loyalists. Signs of dissension in the group’s ranks along various lines have emerged, though the Taliban have a history of 
effectively managing internal disputes. Some Afghans have sought to advocate for their rights and express opposition to the 
Taliban in nonviolent demonstrations, which the Taliban have sometimes violently dispersed, but the Taliban do not appear 
to face effective political opposition. Other Afghans have taken up arms against the Taliban, claiming guerilla-style attacks 
against Taliban forces and calling for international assistance. The regional Islamic State affiliate has conducted attacks 
against Taliban forces, Afghan civilians, and international targets alike.  

Some Members of Congress have focused on a number of impacts of the Taliban’s renewed rule on U.S. interests: 
•  Counterterrorism. The Taliban takeover has had different impacts on the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, 

historic Taliban adversaries and partners, respectively. With no U.S. military forces based in Afghanistan 
or neighboring states, the United States is pursuing an “over-the-horizon” counterterrorism approach. 
•  Women and Girls. Taliban actions have been detrimental for the status of women and girls in Afghanistan, 
a longtime U.S. policy concern, with girls prohibited from attending school above the primary level and 
women’s roles drastically curtailed, including an April 2023 decision to ban women from working for the 
United Nations in Afghanistan.  

•  Relocating U.S. Partners. Some Members of Congress have closely followed ongoing U.S. efforts to 

relocate remaining U.S. citizens, as well as the tens of thousands of Afghans who worked for U.S. efforts 
and seek to leave the country. 

Some Members have also expressed concern about dire humanitarian conditions in Afghanistan. Since the Taliban takeover, 
Afghanistan has faced intersecting and overwhelming humanitarian and economic crises, a result of challenges both 
preexisting (such as natural disasters and Afghanistan’s weak economic base) and new (such as the cut-off of international 
development assistance, U.S. sanctions on the Taliban, and the U.S. hold on Afghan central bank assets). In response, the 
United States has provided over $2 billion in humanitarian and development assistance since August 2021 and the Biden 
Administration has issued general licenses authorizing various humanitarian and commercial transactions. The 
Administration also established a Switzerland-based “Afghan Fund” to hold and potentially disburse some of Afghanistan’s 
central bank assets to support the Afghan economy; the Fund has not, as of June 2023, made any disbursements.  

Congressional oversight of U.S. Afghanistan policy has featured numerous hearings, past and ongoing investigations, and the 
creation of the Afghanistan War Commission. Congress has also imposed a variety of reporting requirements to monitor 
dynamics in Afghanistan and their implications for U.S. policy. Going forward, Congress may consider further reporting 
requirements, resources, or investigative efforts related to various U.S. interests as it evaluates the Biden Administration’s 
budget request and defense authorization measures and examines lessons learned in Afghanistan. Future reports from the 
congressionally created Afghanistan War Commission and other bodies may offer lessons for legislators. 

Congressional action could be influenced or constrained by a lack of reliable information about events in Afghanistan and the 
historical legacy of U.S. conflict with the Taliban. Perhaps more challengingly, the Biden Administration and many in 
Congress seek to ameliorate humanitarian and economic conditions in Afghanistan, but without taking any action that boosts 
the Taliban’s position or that may be perceived as doing so. Pursuing these policies in tandem may prove complicated given 
the Taliban’s evident aversion to make compromises in response to international pressure and its apparent willingness to 
accept considerable humanitarian and economic suffering in Afghanistan as the price of that uncompromising stance.

Afghanistan: Background and U.S. Policy 

Introduction 
This report provides background information and analysis on developments in Afghanistan and 
implications for U.S. policy, including 

• 

• 
• 

the Taliban’s government and the impact of their rule on terrorist groups, human 
rights, and the ability of U.S. Afghan partners to leave the country;  
regional dynamics; and  
the intersecting humanitarian and economic crises facing the country. 

The report also provides information on legislation and other congressional action related to 
Afghanistan. The challenge at the heart of many U.S. policy debates over which Congress has 
influence (including humanitarian assistance, U.S. sanctions, and the status of U.S.-based central 
bank assets) is how to prioritize and, if possible, reconcile two U.S. interests: supporting the 
Afghan people and refraining from bolstering the Taliban’s rule.  

Background: Taliban Takeover 
The chapter of Afghan history that ended in 2021 arguably began in 2001, when the United 
States, in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, led a military campaign against 
Al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban government that harbored it. In the subsequent 20 years, the 
United States suffered thousands of military casualties in Afghanistan, mostly at the hands of the 
rising Taliban insurgency, and Congress appropriated over $146 billion for reconstruction and 
security forces there. During this same period, an elected Afghan government replaced the 
Taliban and, with significant U.S. and international support, made modest but uneven 
improvements in most measures of human development, though Afghanistan remained one of the 
world’s poorest and most corrupt countries.  

At the outset of 2021, the Afghan government was a partner in U.S. counterterrorism efforts, the 
result of nearly 20 years of substantial U.S. and international support, including the deployment 
of hundreds of thousands of troops and the provision of tens of billions of dollars in assistance. 
President Donald Trump had withdrawn all but 2,500 U.S. troops, the lowest U.S. force level 
since 2001, in advance of the full military withdrawal to which the United States agreed in the 
February 2020 U.S.-Taliban agreement.1 U.S. officials committed to continue to provide financial 
support to Afghan forces and expressed confidence about their capabilities vis-a-vis the Taliban, 
while conceding that those forces remained reliant on U.S. support.2 

At the same time, the Taliban were arguably at their strongest since 2001, when they were driven 
from power by U.S., international, and U.S.-backed Afghan forces, having steadily gained 
territory and improved their tactical capabilities over the course of their resilient two-decade 

1 After more than a year of negotiations, U.S. and Taliban representatives signed a bilateral agreement on February 29, 
2020, agreeing to two “interconnected” “guarantees”: the withdrawal of all U.S. and international forces by May 2021, 
and unspecified Taliban action to prevent other groups (including Al Qaeda) from using Afghan soil to threaten the 
United States and its allies. The text of the agreement is available at https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/
02/Agreement-For-Bringing-Peace-to-Afghanistan-02.29.20.pdf. Nonpublic annexes accompanied the agreement.

insurgency. The Afghan government against which the Taliban fought was weakened by deep 
internal divisions, factional infighting, and endemic corruption. 

Several weeks after President Joseph Biden confirmed that international forces would depart 
Afghanistan by the fall of 2021, Taliban forces began a sweeping advance that captured wide 
swaths of the country. While the Taliban faced stiff, if ultimately unsuccessful, resistance from 
government forces in some areas, others were taken with minimal fighting.3 The Taliban captured 
their first provincial capital on August 6, after which the collapse of the Afghan government and 
its security forces accelerated. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, whose seven-year tenure was 
characterized by electoral crises, pervasive corruption, and the gradual deterioration of Afghan 
military forces, fled the country on August 15. Taliban fighters began entering Kabul that same 
day, taking effective control of the country. 

Taliban Government 
On September 7, 2021, the Taliban announced a “caretaker government” to rule Afghanistan. The 
Taliban refer to their government, as they have for decades referred to themselves, as the Islamic 
Emirate of Afghanistan. The Taliban, who did not enact a formal constitution during their 1996-
2001 rule, have said they intend to govern according to Islamic law (sharia) but, according to one 
group of experts, “remain remarkably ambiguous when it comes to the type of Islamic state they 
want to form in Afghanistan.”4 

Haibatullah Akhundzada, Taliban leader since the 2016 killing of his predecessor in a U.S. drone 
strike, holds supreme power as the group’s emir. He has made few reported public appearances 
and only one photograph of him is known to be publicly available.5 Despite Taliban promises to 
form an inclusive government,6 nearly all members of the government are former officials from 
the Taliban’s prior rule or longtime loyalists. All are male, the vast majority are ethnic Pashtuns 
(Afghanistan’s largest ethnic group, which represents a plurality of the population), and most are 
from southern Afghanistan. Over half were, and remain, designated for terrorism-related U.S. 
and/or U.N. sanctions, including the Acting Interior Minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani. The U.S. 
Department of State has for years offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to 
the arrest of Haqqani, who is the head of the Haqqani Network, a U.S.-designated Foreign 
Terrorist Organization (FTO) that conducted numerous attacks against U.S. and other 
international targets in Afghanistan.  

Some reports since the Taliban takeover have indicated dissension in the group’s ranks along 
various lines. While the Taliban have a history of effectively managing internal disputes, 
governing Afghanistan presents new and unique challenges to the group’s consensus-based 
decision-making.7 Points of tension reportedly have existed between members of the group’s

political wing and its military leaders (such as the Haqqanis) over who deserves the most credit 
for the group’s victory;8 between a leadership that seeks stability and rank and file fighters who 
are struggling to adjust to post-conflict life;9 and between those with different ideological 
perspectives (including on education for girls; see below).10 In a February 2023 speech, Haqqani 
criticized “power monopolization” within the Taliban, prompting other Taliban figures to state 
that criticisms should be voiced privately.11 Some of these divisions are mirrored by an 
increasingly significant geographic divide between the Taliban’s political leadership in Kabul and 
the clerical establishment in Kandahar (where the emir is based and to which the Taliban have 
reportedly relocated some senior officials).12 

The Taliban and Drug Production 

The Taliban have at times accommodated, actively facilitated, or efficiently repressed drug production and 
trafficking in territory under their control, sometimes pursuing contradictory policies simultaneously in different 
geographic areas or with respect to various aspects of the drug trade. In 2000, when they were previously in 
power, the Taliban banned opium poppy cultivation, nearly eliminating cultivation in Taliban-controlled areas at a 
time when Afghanistan was the world’s largest producer of opium.13 That ban came to an end with the Taliban’s 
fall in 2001, and opium production reportedly rebounded immediately. The Taliban’s insurgency became entwined 
with the booming opium economy, with the financial and political benefits of that trade evidently trumping the 
group’s ideological opposition to opium production. In April 2022, after the Taliban had returned to power, 
Akhundzada issued a decree again banning opium poppy cultivation. In June 2023, David Mansfield, a prominent 
researcher, estimated that despite “widespread skepticism” the ban had been effectively implemented, with poppy 
cultivation reduced by a “truly unprecedented” amount.14 A subsequent tweet from the U.S. Special 
Representative for Afghanistan stated, “Reports that the Taliban have implemented policies to significantly 
decrease opium poppy production this year are credible and important.”15 The economic impact is likely to be 
uneven but considerable, with the potential for increased emigration for those least able to cope with the ban and 
its effects.16  

Current and Potential Opposition 

While the Taliban’s August 2021 takeover was swift, its triumph, according to many analysts, did 
not reflect massive popular support for the movement so much as a lack of support for the former 
government.17 Many elements of Afghan society, particularly in urban areas, appear to view the 
Taliban with skepticism, fear, or hostility, and small numbers of Afghans have demonstrated

nonviolently to advocate for their rights and express opposition to the Taliban.18 The Taliban have 
often violently dispersed these protests, and have sought to stifle dissenting voices, including with 
the March 2023 arrest of prominent education activist Matiullah Wesa.19 In December 2022, the 
U.N. Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan said, “There is no significant 
visible political opposition to the Taliban inside Afghanistan,” and exiled officials associated with 
the former government “are fragmented and their statements have decreasing resonance for the 
population inside Afghanistan.”20 

The Taliban face armed opposition from two very different quarters. The first is the National 
Resistance Front (NRF), made up of figures aligned with the former Afghan state. NRF leaders 
have appealed for U.S. and international support and have retained Washington, DC-based 
representation.21 They have not won explicit public backing from any foreign countries, perhaps 
due to the Taliban’s relatively stronger military position and closer Taliban ties with regional 
powers, including some that formerly supported Taliban opponents in the 1990s, such as Russia 
and Iran. The NRF has claimed numerous attacks against Taliban fighters, mostly in and around 
the central province of Panjshir, but it is difficult to assess the veracity of such claims, which the 
Taliban dismiss as “propaganda.”22 Still, the NRF does not appear to have either the military 
capabilities or the broad-based public support that would likely be necessary to seriously threaten 
the Taliban’s position.23  

An arguably more potent armed threat to the Taliban is the local Islamic State affiliate (Islamic 
State-Khorasan Province, ISKP, also known as ISIS-K), a longtime Taliban adversary. ISKP has 
opposed the Taliban since its 2015 establishment, viewing the Taliban’s Afghanistan-focused 
nationalist political project as counter to the Islamic State’s universalist vision of a global 
caliphate. ISKP has launched multiple attacks against Taliban targets, killing several senior 
officials (including provincial governors in March 2023 and June 2023). In addition, ISKP has 
claimed attacks against Afghan civilians (mostly targeting Afghanistan’s Shia minority, the 
Hazaras) and a number of externally-oriented operations, including cross border rocket attacks 
against Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, attacks against the Russian and Pakistani embassies in Kabul, 
and an assault on a Kabul hotel frequented by Chinese nationals.24 U.N. sanctions monitors assess

24 Hazaras comprise 10%-15% of Afghanistan’s population. Since their August 2021 takeover, the Taliban have 
demonstrated a more accepting official stance toward the Hazaras than was the case during their former rule, 
particularly in urban areas, despite some reports of killings and forced displacement in the Hazaras’ historic homelands 
in central Afghanistan in fall 2021. While the Taliban government has not persecuted Hazaras, many Hazaras fault the 
Taliban for not establishing an inclusive government and not stopping the ISKP attacks that have repeatedly targeted 
Hazaras. Nilly Kohzad, “‘It doesn’t matter if we get killed,’ Afghanistan’s Hazaras speak out,” Diplomat, May 27,

the group’s attacks are intended “to portray the Taliban as incapable of providing security” and 
“to undermine the relationship between the Taliban and neighboring countries.”25  

Regional Dynamics: Pakistan and Other Neighbors 
Regional dynamics directly affect developments in Afghanistan, which is landlocked and has 
throughout its history been the object of intervention by its neighbors and other foreign powers. 
Events in Afghanistan also have consequences for those neighbors. 

Pakistan.26 The neighboring state widely considered most important in this regard is Pakistan, 
which has played an active, and by many accounts destabilizing, role in Afghan affairs for 
decades, including by actively supporting the Taliban during its 1990s rule and much of its 
subsequent insurgency. Many analysts regarded the Taliban takeover at least initially as a triumph 
for Pakistan’s regional policy, pointing to statements of evident support for the takeover from 
Pakistani leaders.27 Senior Pakistani officials have held numerous meetings with the new Taliban 
government, both in Kabul and Islamabad, since August 2021. 

However, there are some indications that the Taliban’s return to power may pose challenges for 
Pakistan. The Taliban’s victory has arguably given a morale and perhaps material boost to 
Pakistan-based Islamist terrorist groups, including the so-called Pakistani Taliban (Tehreek-i 
Taliban-i Pakistan, or TTP, a U.S.-designated FTO).28 TTP attacks against Pakistani security 
forces increased after August 2021, reportedly prompting the Pakistani government to seek the 
Afghan Taliban’s mediation of several ceasefires.29 The TTP has resumed attacks against 
Pakistani targets, including a January 2023 attack (claimed by a TTP faction) that targeted police 
officers and killed over 100. Afghanistan-Pakistan relations are further complicated by the 
presence of over 1 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, as well as a long-running and ethnically 
tinged dispute over their shared 1,600-mile border, at which Taliban and Pakistani government 
forces intermittently clashed in 2022.30 

Iran. Iran, with which Afghanistan shares its western border, opposed the Taliban’s 1990s rule 
but has maintained relations with the group while emphasizing the need for representation for 
Afghanistan’s ethnic and religious groups with which Iran has close ties (namely Tajiks, who 
speak a variant of Persian, and Hazaras, who are mostly Shia Muslims). Disputes over water 
rights and refugees persist, along with sporadic border clashes.31 

Central Asia. Afghanistan’s Central Asian neighbors (Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) 
have responded in varying ways to the Taliban’s takeover. The Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan 
governments appear to be prioritizing stability and economic ties, including the planned

Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) natural gas pipeline, and have had official 
engagements with the Taliban. Tajikistan, on the other hand, has opposed the Taliban and offered 
shelter to the anti-Taliban National Resistance Front, a consequence both of Tajikistan’s own 
struggles with Islamist militancy as well as ties with Afghan Tajiks (the country’s second largest 
ethnic group), some of whom oppose the Taliban’s rule.32 

China. The prospect of greater Chinese influence and activity in Afghanistan has attracted some 
congressional attention since the Taliban takeover. China, which played a relatively limited role in 
Afghanistan under the former government, made some economic investments in Afghanistan 
(particularly in the development of Afghan minerals and other resources) prior to the Taliban 
takeover, but major projects have not come to fruition due to instability, lack of infrastructure, and 
other limitations.33 Despite concerns about Afghanistan-based Islamist terrorist groups, China has 
signaled tacit acceptance of the Taliban’s rule, with its foreign minister emphasizing in a May 
2022 visit to Kabul that China “respects the independent choices made by the Afghan people.”34 
In May 2023, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China agreed to extend China’s Belt and Road Initiative 
(BRI) to Afghanistan via the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.35 

U.S. Policy Impacts of the Taliban’s Return to Power 
Renewed Taliban rule in Afghanistan has implications for a number of U.S. policy interests. It has 
created opportunities and challenges for the various terrorist groups that have a presence in 
Afghanistan, and has forced the United States to pursue an “over-the-horizon” counterterrorism 
approach that lacks a local partner. Advancing protection of women’s and other human rights has 
been another major U.S. policy goal in Afghanistan since 2001; the Taliban have taken numerous 
actions to roll back those rights since retaking power. U.S. policymakers, including many 
Members of Congress, have also focused on securing the relocation of remaining U.S. citizens 
and Afghans who previously worked for the U.S. government, a halting effort that remains 
ongoing as of June 2023.  

Counterterrorism  

Islamist extremist terrorist groups have for decades operated in Afghanistan, and the Taliban have 
related to them in varying ways. ISKP and Al Qaeda (AQ) are two of the most significant of these 
terrorist groups, and the Taliban’s takeover has affected them differently.  

Long a significant U.S. counterterrorism concern, ISKP has clashed with the Taliban, as 
mentioned above. Under the former U.S.-backed Afghan government, the United States launched 
airstrikes in support of Taliban offensives against ISKP, a rare area of prior U.S.-Taliban 
cooperation.36 In February 2022, the U.S. State Department announced rewards of up to $10 
million each for information related to ISKP leader Sanaullah Ghafari as well as those responsible 
for the August 26, 2021, ISKP attack at Kabul airport that killed and injured hundreds of people, 
including over 30 U.S. servicemembers.37 In April 2023, the White House announced that the

Taliban had killed the leader of the ISKP cell responsible for the airport attack.38 U.S. Central 
Command (CENTCOM) commander General Eric Kurilla estimated in March 2023 
congressional testimony that ISKP could be capable of conducting “an external operation against 
U.S. or Western interests abroad in under six months.”39 

While ISKP is seen as more operationally ambitious and capable in Afghanistan than Al Qaeda, 
the July 2022 U.S. killing of Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri in Kabul attracted considerable 
attention to the issue of AQ-Taliban ties.40 Despite (or perhaps because of) U.S. counterterrorism 
pressure, those ties have persisted for decades. The circumstances of Zawahiri’s residence in 
Kabul and what they might reveal about internal Taliban dynamics beyond continued AQ ties 
remain unclear; neither the Taliban nor Al Qaeda officially acknowledged Zawahiri’s death.41 
U.N. sanctions monitors reported in June 2023 that Al Qaeda “maintains a low profile” in 
Afghanistan and that the importance of the group’s Afghanistan-based leadership had declined.42  

From the outset of the U.S. withdrawal, U.S. officials said that the United States would maintain 
the ability to combat terrorist threats in Afghanistan such as ISKP and Al Qaeda without a 
military presence on the ground there by utilizing assets based outside of Afghanistan, in what 
U.S. officials have described as an “over-the-horizon” approach.43 With the Taliban in control of 
Afghanistan, the United States has had to alter any plans that had been predicated on the 
continued existence of the former Afghan government and its security forces. In March 2023 
testimony, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said of U.S. 
counterterrorism capabilities in Afghanistan: 

It’s not what it was. Nothing’s going to replace having troops and Afghan security forces 
and the amount of infrastructure we had. That’s not going to get replaced. We do have the 
capability  to  see  into  Afghanistan  with  a  variety  of  ISR  [intelligence,  surveillance,  and 
reconnaissance] assets and to determine any threats to the homeland. If we pick those up, 
we have the ability to strike at great distance. 

The Biden Administration has cited the Zawahiri strike as a demonstration of U.S. over-the-
horizon capabilities.44 Some Members of Congress have criticized the approach, with one calling 
it a “farce.”45

Afghanistan: Background and U.S. Policy 

Afghan Women and Girls46  

The Afghanistan in which the Taliban came to power in August 2021 was in many ways a 
different country than the one they last ruled in 2001. After 2001, women became active 
participants in many parts of Afghan society; protections for them were enshrined in the country’s 
2004 constitution. Though the Taliban takeover reduced the high levels of violence that 
characterized the conflict, a development particularly welcomed by women in rural areas, the 
Taliban’s return to power has made Afghanistan “the most repressive country in the world 
regarding women’s rights,” according to the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in 
Afghanistan (UNAMA).47 

Upon taking power, the Taliban closed the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, which had been a part of 
the former Afghan government, and reinstated the Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and 
Prevention of Vice, which enforced the Taliban’s highly oppressive rule in the 1990s. The 
ministry monitors the implementation of Taliban edicts that seek to impose new restrictions on 
Afghan women.48 Those edicts include a December 2021 prohibition on women driving long 
distances or flying without a male guardian, a May 2022 decree mandating punishments for the 
male relatives of women who do not wear a hijab that fully covers their bodies, and a November 
2022 decision to ban women from public parks and bath houses.49 According to a report from 
U.N. experts,  

In  their  totality,  the  edicts  significantly  limit  women’s  and  girls’  ability  to  engage  in 
society,  have  access  to  basic  services,  and  to  earn  a  living.  Women  have  described  the 
continual  announcement  of  restrictions  as  ‘day  by  day,  the  walls  close  in,’  feeling 
‘suffocated,’ and the cumulative effect leaving them ‘without hope.’50 

Additionally, media sources report that divorce is becoming more difficult to obtain, even in cases 
of abuse, and that some Afghan women fear that their divorces from abusive husbands may be 
nullified.51 

Of particular concern to many U.S. policymakers are Taliban policies toward education for 
Afghan girls; per the U.N., “Afghanistan is the only country in the world where women and girls’ 
access to education is suspended.”52 Taliban spokespersons said in early 2022 that girls’ 
secondary schools, effectively shuttered in most of the country since the August 2021 takeover, 
would reopen with the start of the new school year in late March 2022.53 However, on March 23, 
2022, with some girls already present in schools, the Taliban abruptly reversed course and 
announced that secondary schools for girls would remain closed, shocking many observers.54 The 
United States and many other countries condemned the decision, and in October 2022, the State 
Department announced visa restrictions on several Taliban figures responsible for the repression

of women and girls in Afghanistan.55 One analysis attributes the change to the advocacy of 
hardline clerics within the group and Akhundzada.56 Other Taliban figures, including both 
Baradar and the Haqqanis, reportedly support secondary education for girls (and some educate 
their own daughters abroad).57 In December 2022, the Taliban also suspended women from 
attending university.58 The evidently greater influence of the group’s traditionally conservative 
leaders, and the unwillingness or inability of more pragmatic figures to assert themselves, 
suggests that external actors may have limited leverage over Taliban decisions.  

The impact of Taliban restrictions on girls’ education has been considerable: U.N. experts stated 
in June 2023 that “reports of depression and suicide are widespread, especially among adolescent 
girls prevented from pursuing education.”59 Some Afghan women have reportedly continued to 
provide informal education to girls in private “secret schools,” and secondary schools for girls 
have remained open in some areas (largely in the north, where less conservative views on girls’ 
education prevail).60 Some Afghan women and girls have also attempted to continue their studies 
online, though those efforts are impeded by technological and infrastructure challenges.61 Some 
girls’ schools have continued to face attacks under Taliban rule, notably a September 2022 suicide 
bombing in Kabul and June 2023 reported poisoning in northern Afghanistan.62 

Beyond education, the Taliban have also severely restricted women’s access to employment. In 
December 2022, the Taliban banned women from working for national and international NGOs, 
threatening to suspend the licenses of NGOs that do not comply. U.N. Security Council members 
said the decision “would have a significant and immediate impact for humanitarian operations in 
country, including those of the UN.”63 Many implementing partners halted their work after the 
announcement of these restrictions, but some have since reportedly resumed some operations 
after reaching “acceptable workarounds” with local authorities.64 While interruptions to 
humanitarian operations have negative implications for many of the 28 million Afghans in need 
of assistance, women and girls have been disproportionately affected. Afghan women face more 
barriers to health care services, experience higher levels of unemployment, and adopt negative

coping mechanisms (such as reducing food consumption and selling belongings for food) at 
higher rates than men. Families may also be increasing the early and forced marriage of girls.65  

In April 2023, the Taliban further banned women from working for the U.N.; the U.N. then 
instructed all Afghan staff to not report to the office while it considered how to respond, an order 
that the U.N. reportedly dropped in early May.66 Women are permitted to work in healthcare (for 
other women and girls) but face Taliban monitoring and interference.67 Other women have 
attempted to circumvent Taliban restrictions on working by operating online.68 

Ongoing Relocations of U.S. Citizens and Certain Afghans 

The Taliban’s entry into Kabul on August 15, 2021, triggered the mass evacuation of tens of 
thousands of U.S. citizens (including all diplomatic personnel), partner country citizens, and 
Afghans who worked for international efforts and/or the former Afghan government. U.S. 
officials say that U.S. military forces facilitated the evacuation of 124,000 individuals, including 
5,300 U.S. citizens, as part of Operation Allies Refuge, “the largest air evacuation in US 
history.”69 Since that operation ended on August 30, 2021, the Biden Administration has said that 
it has assisted in the departure of 13,000 Afghans from the country, in addition to 950 U.S. 
citizens (as of April 2023) and 600 lawful permanent residents (as of August 2022).70  

U.S. officials have characterized their efforts to secure the relocation of remaining U.S. citizens 
and eligible Afghan partners who seek to leave the country as an “enduring mission.”71 According 
to the State Department, the number of U.S. citizens it has identified in Afghanistan has 
fluctuated amid continued relocations and because of cases in which additional U.S. citizens 
come forward to ask for assistance to leave.72 On March 23, 2023, Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken said there were “about 175” U.S. citizens in Afghanistan, of which 44 were “ready to 
leave, and we are working to effectuate their departure.”73 Additionally, the State Department 
reported that as of March 2023, over 150,000 Afghan SIV applicants whose applications were 
undergoing processing remained in Afghanistan.74

Afghanistan: Background and U.S. Policy 

Some Afghans who seek to relocate reportedly remain in hiding, fearing Taliban retribution. The 
Taliban issued a general amnesty after coming to power, but, according to various accounts, the 
Taliban have carried out reprisals against figures aligned with the former government, including 
hundreds of killings.75  

The Taliban have at times reportedly interfered with relocation flights, including by demanding 
seats for Taliban-selected individuals to work abroad and remit money, but in general appear to 
have not significantly impeded the departure of Afghans.76 The United States has reportedly paid, 
through Qatar, for tickets on some Afghan airlines that fly to Qatar for individuals to leave 
Afghanistan.77 Impediments to relocations from Afghanistan include logistical issues at Kabul’s 
international airport and issues with Afghans obtaining travel documentation. 

Economic Contraction and Humanitarian Crisis 
The Taliban’s return to power and resulting economic contraction have exacerbated one of the 
worst humanitarian crises in the world in Afghanistan, long one of the world’s poorest and most 
aid-dependent countries. A number of U.S. policy actions, including the cut-off of international 
development assistance, longstanding U.S. and international sanctions on the Taliban, and the 
U.S. hold on Afghanistan’s central bank assets, appear relevant to the economic breakdown that 
underlies the humanitarian crisis.  

The United States and other international donors provided billions of dollars a year to support the 
former Afghan government, financing over half of its $6 billion annual budget and as much as 
80% of total public expenditures.78 Much of that development assistance halted with the Taliban’s 
August 2021 takeover, leading the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) to contract by over 
20% in 2021.79 In 2022, however, the Afghan economy reached “a fragile low-level equilibrium,” 
contracting by 3.6%, with “the Taliban’s economic management…more effective than expected,” 
per the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan.80 The U.N. 
Development Program (UNDP) projects slight GDP growth for 2023 (1.3%) and 2024 (0.4%).81 
That growth is likely to be outstripped by population increase (around 2%), leading estimated per 
capita GDP to decline from $359 in 2022 to $345 in 2024.  

Those estimates assume a stable level of international support, including from the United Nations, 
which requested $4.6 billion for Afghanistan for 2023, the largest ever annual appeal for a single 
country.82 In May 2023, the appeal was revised to $3.2 billion for 2023 due to “the changing

operating environment,” including the bans on women working for NGOs and the U.N.83 
International support includes cash payments; the U.N. delivered $1.85 billion in cash into 
Afghanistan in 2022 for humanitarian operations.84  

The economic contraction has exacerbated what was already a severe humanitarian crisis in 
Afghanistan prior to August 2021, due primarily to conflict, drought, and the COVID-19 
pandemic. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported in February 
2023 that humanitarian partners provided 26.1 million Afghans with at least one form of 
assistance in 2022, and that “the outlook remains grim” given projected droughts and higher 
commodity prices.85 As of May 2023, the World Food Program projected that 15.3 million 
Afghans would be food-insecure in mid-2023 and that 28 million people (two-thirds of 
Afghanistan’s population) would require some form of assistance this year.86  

U.S. Policy  

The United States has provided over $2.1 billion in assistance for Afghanistan since the Taliban 
takeover, making it the largest international donor.87 The Biden Administration’s FY2024 budget 
request proposes $143 million for health, education, and other forms of bilateral assistance in 
Afghanistan (on top of any emergency humanitarian assistance). The lack of a U.S. diplomatic 
presence in Afghanistan may complicate or constrain the implementation and/or oversight of U.S. 
funding. In March 2023, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Mike McCaul directed the 
Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) to assess, among other issues, 
the extent to which U.S. foreign assistance funds have been diverted to the Taliban in the form of 
taxes or fees.88 

Beyond assistance, the two U.S. policy areas that appear to have the greatest relevance to the 
economic and humanitarian situation are sanctions and the ongoing U.S. hold on Afghanistan’s 
central bank reserves. U.S. sanctions on the Taliban (in place in various forms since 1999) 
remain, but it is unclear to what extent they are affecting humanitarian conditions in 
Afghanistan.89 Since the Taliban’s takeover, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has issued 
several general licenses stating that U.S. sanctions on the Taliban do not prohibit the provision of 
assistance to Afghanistan and authorizing various humanitarian and commercial transactions.90 
Still, the continued existence of sanctions might lead financial institutions, private sector firms, or 
other actors to “de-risk” Afghanistan by not engaging in the country rather than risk violation of 
U.S. sanctions.91  

The Biden Administration’s hold on the U.S.-based assets of the Afghan central bank (DAB) has 
also drawn scrutiny. Imposed days after the Taliban entered Kabul to prevent the Taliban from

accessing the funds, the Taliban and some foreign leaders have urged the United States to release 
the hold on those assets, which total around $7 billion.92 On February 11, 2022, the Biden 
Administration announced that it would “seek to facilitate access of $3.5 billion [of the assets] ... 
for the benefit of the Afghan people,” pending ongoing litigation related to the September 11, 
2001, attacks.93 In September 2022, the Administration announced the establishment of an 
“Afghan Fund” (based in Switzerland) to “make targeted disbursements of that $3.5 billion to 
help provide greater stability to the Afghan economy.”94 The fund’s four member Board of 
Trustees met for the first time in November 2022.95 It has not, as of June 2023, made any 
disbursements. In early 2023, USAID reported to SIGAR that it had undertaken a third-party 
assessment of the DAB and its anti-money laundering/countering terrorist financing controls but 
that “the results were not finalized as of mid-April 2023.”96  

Congressional Action and Outlook 
The Taliban’s takeover attracted intense congressional and public scrutiny. U.S. public attention 
appears to have since decreased, but Afghanistan remains the subject of congressional 
engagement as some Members seek to account for the evident failure of U.S. efforts and grapple 
with the reality of the Taliban’s renewed rule.97 

Congressional oversight of Afghanistan has been robust. Congressional committees held at least 
ten hearings specifically on Afghanistan in the weeks after the Taliban’s takeover.98 Senate 
Foreign Relations minority staff released an assessment of the August 2021 evacuation in 
February 2022, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee then-ranking member produced an 
interim report on the withdrawal in August 2022.99 In addition, Congress established the 
Afghanistan War Commission (AWC, Section 1094 of the FY2022 National Defense 
Authorization Act, NDAA, P.L. 117-81) charged with examining the war and developing “a series 
of lessons learned and recommendations for the way forward” in a final report to be issued within

three years. Per its website as of early June 2023, the Commission “plans to formally convene in 
early 2023.”100 

In the 118th Congress, two House committees have sought further information from the 
Administration related to the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan and related contingency 
plans.101 One of them, the House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC), said in its February 2023

planning, and execution related to the August 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan,” as well as 
“examine U.S. policy toward Afghanistan.”102 Three House panels (HFAC, the House Committee

Counterterrorism, Law Enforcement, and Intelligence) have held Afghanistan-focused hearings in 
the 118th Congress.103 

In shaping U.S. policy toward Afghanistan, Congress may consider a number of options. 

•  Congress may examine how U.S. assistance, and conditions thereon, may affect 

Taliban actions, including with regard to women’s rights more broadly and the 
ability of Afghan girls to attend school in particular, to inform congressional 
consideration of the Administration’s budget request and action on FY2024 
appropriations; 

•  Congress may request or mandate additional information from the Administration 
about the number and status of U.S. citizens and Afghan partners who remain in 
Afghanistan and about the status of U.S. efforts to secure their relocation, 
including resources devoted to those efforts, obstacles to further relocations, and 
Administration plans to overcome those obstacles; 

•  Congress may examine the impact of U.S. sanctions on the designated 

entities/individuals, the Afghan economy, and Afghan society more broadly, 
including by requiring reporting thereon from the Administration and/or the 
Government Accountability Office, to assess whether they are achieving their 
intended objectives; and 

•  Congress may examine the impact and efficacy of oversight of previous U.S. 
efforts in Afghanistan to shape future U.S. policy efforts, congressional 
authorizing and appropriations measures, and oversight mechanisms (including 
those intended to oversee U.S. assistance to other foreign partners, such as 
Ukraine). Relevant reports from the AWC and the Department of Defense (and 
the federally funded research and development center with whom the Department 
contracts, as directed by Section 1323 of P.L. 117-81) are due to be submitted 
within approximately one and two years, respectively.

Afghanistan: Background and U.S. Policy 

Going forward, U.S. policy, including congressional action, could be influenced or constrained by 
a number of factors, including 

• 

• 

a dearth of information about dynamics in Afghanistan, given the lack of U.S. 
diplomats and other on the ground observers and Taliban-imposed limitations on 
journalists; and 
the historical legacy of U.S. conflict with the Taliban, which may make 
cooperation with the group, even to advance U.S. policy priorities, politically 
difficult. 

Perhaps more fundamental is the challenge of how to pursue U.S. policy priorities that may be 
difficult to reconcile: stabilizing Afghanistan and providing support to Afghans while avoiding 
actions that might benefit the Taliban. While providing humanitarian aid may be sufficient to 
stave off mass casualties, it is unlikely to sustainably improve economic conditions. Financial 
assistance could improve the Afghan economy, ameliorating the humanitarian situation, but 
comes with the risk of diversion of some funds or broader benefits to the Taliban. In considering 
Administration budget requests, Members of Congress may weigh these and other options, 
including conditions on U.S. assistance. 

The Taliban have called for international recognition, assistance, and sanctions relief, but since 
returning to power they have not shown a willingness to make compromises on important issues 
to obtain them. Nearly every country, U.S. partners and adversaries alike, has urged the Taliban to 
form a more inclusive government, and many countries have joined the United States in calling 
for the group to lift restrictions on women and girls and break ties with terrorist groups. In 
response, the Taliban have stalled, equivocated, and ultimately either ignored or rejected outright 
these calls. Foreign policy tools that the United States has traditionally used as leverage may not 
be as effective in Afghanistan as in some other contexts.104
