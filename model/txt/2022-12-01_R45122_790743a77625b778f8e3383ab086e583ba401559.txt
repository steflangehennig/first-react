Afghanistan: Background and U.S. Policy 
in Brief 

The aftershocks of Afghanistan’s watershed year of 2021 continue to reverberate within 
Afghanistan, throughout its region, and in the United States. In 2021, U.S. and international 
forces departed after nearly two decades of operations in Afghanistan; the internationally backed 
Afghan government and its military forces collapsed; and the Taliban, a Sunni Islamist extremist 
group that formerly ruled the country from 1996 to 2001, retook power. Afghans and Americans 
alike, including Members of Congress and other U.S. policymakers, continue to grapple with the 
reality of the Taliban’s renewed rule.  

SUMMARY

Clayton Thomas 
Specialist in Middle 
Eastern Affairs 

The Taliban government is dominated by former officials from the Taliban’s prior rule or longtime loyalists, indicating that 
the Taliban have prioritized internal cohesion over outreach to other segments of Afghan society or similar gestures 
advocated by the United States and other countries. Some signs of dissension in the group’s ranks along various lines have 
emerged, though the Taliban have a history of effectively managing internal disputes. Some Afghans have sought to advocate 
for their rights and express opposition to the Taliban in nonviolent demonstrations, which the Taliban have monitored and 
sometimes violently dispersed. Other anti-Taliban Afghans have taken up arms against the Taliban, claiming guerilla-style 
attacks against Taliban forces and calling for international assistance, and the regional Islamic State affiliate has conducted 
attacks against both Taliban forces and Afghan civilians.  

Some Members of Congress have focused on a number of impacts of the Taliban’s renewed rule on U.S. interests: 
  Counterterrorism. The Taliban takeover has had different impacts on the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, 

historic Taliban adversaries and partners, respectively. With no U.S. military forces based in Afghanistan 
or neighboring states, the United States is pursuing an “over-the-horizon” counterterrorism approach. 
  Women and Girls. Taliban actions have been detrimental for the status of women and girls in Afghanistan, 
a longtime U.S. policy concern, with girls prohibited from attending school at the secondary level and 
women’s roles drastically curtailed.  

  Relocating U.S. Partners. Some Members of Congress have closely followed ongoing U.S. efforts to 

relocate remaining U.S. citizens, as well as the tens of thousands of Afghans who worked for U.S. efforts 
and seek to leave the country. 

Some Members have also expressed concern about dire humanitarian conditions in Afghanistan. Since the Taliban takeover, 
Afghanistan has faced intersecting and overwhelming humanitarian and economic crises, a result of challenges both 
preexisting (such as natural disasters and Afghanistan’s weak economic base) and new (such as the cut-off of international 
development assistance, U.S. sanctions on the Taliban, and the U.S. hold on Afghan central bank assets). In response, the 
Biden Administration has provided over $1 billion in humanitarian assistance, issued general licenses authorizing various 
humanitarian and commercial transactions, and established a Switzerland-based “Afghan Fund” to disburse some of 
Afghanistan’s central bank assets to support the Afghan economy.  

Congressional oversight of U.S. Afghanistan policy has featured numerous hearings, past and ongoing investigations, and the 
creation of the Afghanistan War Commission. Congress has also imposed a variety of reporting requirements to monitor 
dynamics in Afghanistan and their implications for U.S. policy. Going forward, Congress may consider further reporting 
requirements, resources, or investigative efforts related to various U.S. interests as it evaluates the Biden Administration’s 
budget request and defense authorization measures. Future reports from the congressionally created Afghanistan War 
Commission and other bodies may offer lessons for legislators 

Congressional action is likely to be influenced, and likely constrained, by a lack of reliable information about events in 
Afghanistan and the historical legacy of U.S. conflict with the Taliban. Perhaps more challengingly, the Biden 
Administration and many in Congress seek to ameliorate humanitarian and economic conditions in Afghanistan, but without 
taking any action that boosts the Taliban’s position or that may be perceived as doing so. Pursuing these policies in tandem 
may prove complicated given the Taliban’s evident aversion to make compromises in response to international pressure and 
its apparent willingness to accept considerable humanitarian and economic suffering as the price of that uncompromising 
stance.

Afghanistan: Background and U.S. Policy in Brief 

Introduction 
The aftershocks of the Taliban’s August 2021 return to power continue to reverberate in 
Afghanistan and the United States alike. This report provides background information and 
analysis on developments in Afghanistan and implications for U.S. policy, including 

 

 
 

the Taliban’s government and the impact of their rule on terrorist groups, human 
rights, and the ability of U.S. Afghan partners to leave the country;  

regional dynamics; and  
the intersecting humanitarian and economic crises facing the country. 

The report also provides information on legislation and other congressional action related to 
Afghanistan. The challenge at the heart of many U.S. policy debates over which Congress has 
influence (including humanitarian assistance, U.S. sanctions, and the status of U.S.-based central 
bank assets) is how to prioritize and, if possible, reconcile two U.S. interests: supporting the 
Afghan people and refraining from bolstering the Taliban’s rule.  

Background: Taliban Takeover 
The chapter of Afghan history that ended in 2021 arguably began in 2001, when the United 
States, in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, led a military campaign against 
Al Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban government that harbored it. In the subsequent 20 years, the 
United States suffered thousands of military casualties in Afghanistan, mostly at the hands of the 
rising Taliban insurgency, and Congress appropriated over $146 billion for reconstruction and 
security forces there. During this same period, an elected Afghan government replaced the 
Taliban and, with significant U.S. and international support, made modest but uneven 
improvements in most measures of human development, though Afghanistan remained one of the 
world’s poorest and most corrupt countries.  

At the outset of 2021, the Afghan government was a close U.S. counterterrorism partner, the 
result of nearly 20 years of substantial U.S. and international support, including the deployment 
of hundreds of thousands of troops and the provision of tens of billions of dollars in assistance. 
President Donald Trump had withdrawn all but 2,500 U.S. troops, the lowest U.S. force level 
since 2001, in advance of the full military withdrawal to which the United States agreed in the 
February 2020 U.S.-Taliban agreement.1 U.S. officials committed to continue to provide financial 
support to Afghan forces and expressed confidence about their capabilities vis-a-vis the Taliban, 
while conceding that those forces remained reliant on U.S. support.2 

At the same time, the Taliban were arguably at their strongest since 2001, when they were driven 
from power by U.S., international, and U.S.-backed Afghan forces, having steadily gained 
territory and improved their tactical capabilities over the course of their resilient two-decade 
insurgency. The Afghan government against which the Taliban fought was weakened by deep 

1 After more than a year of negotiations, U.S. and Taliban representatives signed a bilateral agreement on February 29, 
2020, agreeing to two “interconnected” “guarantees”: the withdrawal of all U.S. and international forces by May 2021, 
and unspecified Taliban action to prevent other groups (including Al Qaeda) from using Afghan soil to threaten the 
United States and its allies. The text of the agreement is available at https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/

internal divisions, factional infighting, and endemic corruption, and Taliban forces enjoyed 
certain advantages over their Afghan government counterparts, including greater cohesion and 
financial sustainability, according to one January 2021 outside assessment.3 

Several weeks after President Joseph Biden confirmed that international forces would depart 
Afghanistan by the fall of 2021, Taliban forces began a sweeping advance that captured wide 
swaths of the country’s rural areas, cementing the group’s hold on some districts in which it 
already had a significant presence. The Taliban’s seizure of other districts was more significant: 
some northern areas had successfully resisted the Taliban militarily when the group was in power 
in the 1990s, making their rapid 2021 fall to the Taliban particularly significant.4 The speed of the 
Taliban’s advance reportedly surprised even some within the group, with one commander saying 
that his forces were intentionally avoiding capturing provincial capitals before the scheduled 
departure of U.S. forces.5 

The Taliban’s advance was secured through both combat and negotiation. While the Taliban faced 
stiff, if ultimately unsuccessful, resistance from government forces in some areas, others were 
taken with minimal fighting.6 In many of these areas, the Taliban reportedly secured the surrender 
or departure of government forces (and the handover of their weapons) with payments or through 
the mediation of local elders seeking to avoid bloodshed.7 The Taliban captured their first 
provincial capital on August 6, after which the collapse of the Afghan government and its security 
forces accelerated. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, whose seven-year tenure was characterized by 
electoral crises, pervasive corruption, and the gradual deterioration of Afghan forces, fled the 
country on August 15 and reportedly remains, as of November 2022, in the United Arab 
Emirates.8 Taliban fighters began entering Kabul that same day, taking effective control of the 
country. 

Taliban Government 
On September 7, 2021, the Taliban announced a “caretaker government” to rule Afghanistan. The 
Taliban refer to their government, as they have for decades referred to themselves, as the Islamic 
Emirate of Afghanistan.9 The Taliban, who did not enact a formal constitution during their 1996-
2001 rule, have said they intend to govern according to Islamic law (sharia) but have not, per a

Afghanistan: Background and U.S. Policy in Brief 

June 2022 U.S. State Department report, established “a clear and cohesive legal framework, 
judicial system, or enforcement mechanisms.”10 

Haibatullah Akhundzada, Taliban leader since the 2016 killing of his predecessor in a U.S. drone 
strike, holds supreme power as the group’s emir. He has made few reported public appearances 
and only one photograph of him is known to be publicly available.11 Nearly all members of the 
government are former officials from the Taliban’s prior rule or longtime loyalists. All are male, 
the vast majority are ethnic Pashtuns (Afghanistan’s largest ethnic group, which represents a 
plurality of the population), and most are from southern Afghanistan. Over half were, and remain, 
designated for terrorism-related U.S. and/or U.N. sanctions, including the Acting Interior 
Minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani. The U.S. Department of State has for years offered a reward of up 
to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of Haqqani, who is the head of the Haqqani 
Network, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) that is responsible for 
numerous attacks against U.S. and other international targets in Afghanistan.  

In the initial days of the transition, some observers had speculated that the Taliban might reach 
out to former Afghan government officials or to others from outside the movement as part of the 
Taliban’s promise to establish an “inclusive government.” The Taliban have not, however, 
reached beyond their own ranks to fill government positions and are reportedly staffing ministries 
with military and/or religious figures with little relevant experience, exacerbating the group’s 
administrative challenges and some internal tensions.12 

Some reports since the Taliban takeover have indicated dissension in the group’s ranks along 
various lines. While the Taliban have a history of effectively managing internal disputes, 
governing Afghanistan presents new and unique challenges to the group’s consensus-based 
decision-making.13 Points of tension reportedly exist between members of the group’s political 
wing (such as Baradar) and its military leaders (such as the Haqqanis) over who deserves the 
most credit for the group’s victory;14 between a leadership that seeks stability and rank and file 
fighters who are struggling to adjust to post-conflict life;15 and between those with different 
ideological perspectives and ethnic identities.16 

Current and Potential Opposition 

While the Taliban’s August 2021 takeover was swift, its triumph, according to many analysts, did 
not reflect massive popular support for the movement so much as a lack of support for the former 
government.17 Many elements of Afghan society, particularly in urban areas, appear to view the

Afghanistan: Background and U.S. Policy in Brief 

Taliban with skepticism, fear, or hostility, and small numbers of Afghans have demonstrated 
nonviolently to advocate for their rights and express opposition to the Taliban.18 The Taliban 
appear to have monitored most protests, and violently dispersed some.19  

The Taliban face organized armed opposition from two very different quarters. The first is the 
National Resistance Front (NRF), made up of figures aligned with the former Afghan state. NRF 
leaders have appealed for U.S. and international support and have retained Washington, DC-based 
representation.20 They have not won public backing from any foreign countries, perhaps due to 
the Taliban’s relatively stronger military position and closer Taliban ties with regional powers, 
including some that formerly supported Taliban opponents in the 1990s, such as Russia and Iran. 
The NRF has claimed numerous attacks against Taliban fighters, mostly in and around the central 
province of Panjshir, but it is difficult to assess the veracity of such claims, which the Taliban 
dismiss as “propaganda.”21 Still, the NRF does not appear to have either the military capabilities 
or the broad-based public support that would likely be necessary to seriously threaten the 
Taliban’s position.22  

An arguably more potent armed threat to the Taliban is the local Islamic State affiliate (Islamic 
State-Khorasan Province, ISKP, also known as ISIS-K), a longtime Taliban adversary. ISKP has 
opposed the Taliban since its 2015 establishment, viewing the Taliban’s Afghanistan-focused 
nationalist political project as counter to the Islamic State’s universalist vision of a global 
caliphate. Since the Taliban takeover, ISKP’s ranks have swelled to as many as 4,000 fighters 
despite a concerted Taliban offensive, and ISKP has claimed responsibility for a number of major 
attacks in 2022 (many targeting Afghanistan’s Shia minority, the Hazaras).23 Experts disagree 
about the potency of the ISKP threat and the Taliban’s self-asserted ability to counter the group 
without external assistance.24  

Regional Dynamics: Pakistan and Other Neighbors 
Regional dynamics directly affect developments in Afghanistan, which is landlocked and has 
throughout its history been the object of intervention by its neighbors and other foreign powers. 
Events in Afghanistan also have consequences for those neighbors. 

Pakistan. The neighboring state widely considered most important in this regard is Pakistan, 
which has played an active, and by many accounts destabilizing, role in Afghan affairs for 
decades, including by actively supporting the Taliban during its 1990s rule and much of its 
subsequent insurgency. Many analysts regarded the Taliban takeover at least initially as a triumph

10%-15% of Afghanistan’s population. Since their August 2021 takeover, the Taliban have demonstrated a more 
accepting official stance toward the Hazaras than was the case during their former rule, particularly in urban areas, 
despite some reports of killings and forced displacement in the Hazaras’ historic homelands in central Afghanistan in 
fall 2021. While the Taliban government has not persecuted Hazaras, many Hazaras fault the Taliban for not 
establishing an inclusive government and not stopping the ISKP attacks that have repeatedly targeted Hazaras. Nilly

for Pakistan’s regional policy, pointing to statements of evident support for the takeover from 
Pakistani leaders.25 Senior Pakistani officials have held numerous meetings with the new Taliban 
government, both in Kabul and Islamabad, since August 2021. 

However, there are some indications that the Taliban’s return to power may pose challenges for 
Pakistan. The Taliban’s victory may provide a morale and perhaps material boost to Pakistan-
based Islamist terrorist groups, including the so-called Pakistani Taliban (Tehreek-i Taliban-i 
Pakistan, or TTP, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization). TTP attacks against Pakistani 
security forces increased after August 2021, reportedly prompting the Pakistani government to 
seek the Afghan Taliban’s mediation of several ceasefires, which appear to have broken down in 
late 2022.26 Afghanistan-Pakistan relations are further complicated by the presence of over 1 
million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, as well as a long-running and ethnically tinged dispute over 
their shared 1,600-mile border, at which Taliban and Pakistani government forces intermittently 
clashed in 2022.27 

Iran. Iran, with which Afghanistan shares its western border, opposed the Taliban’s 1990s rule 
but has maintained relations with the group while emphasizing the need for representation for 
Afghanistan’s ethnic and religious groups with which Iran has close ties (namely Tajiks, who 
speak a variant of Persian, and Hazaras, who are mostly Shia Muslims). Official Taliban visits to 
Tehran preceded the group’s August 2021 takeover and have continued since then, including with 
the visit of the Taliban’s acting foreign minister in January 2022. Disputes in 2022 over water 
rights and refugees could, however, portend future tensions.28 

Central Asia. Afghanistan’s Central Asian neighbors (Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) 
have responded in varying ways to the Taliban’s takeover. The Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan 
governments appear to be prioritizing economic ties, including the planned Turkmenistan-
Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) natural gas pipeline, and have had numerous official 
engagements with the Taliban. Tajikistan, on the other hand, has opposed the Taliban and offered 
shelter to the anti-Taliban National Resistance Front, a result both of Tajikistan’s own struggles 
with Islamist militancy as well as ties with Afghan Tajiks (the country’s second largest ethnic 
group), some of whom oppose the Taliban’s rule.29 

China. The prospect of greater Chinese influence and activity in Afghanistan has attracted some 
congressional attention since the Taliban takeover.30 China, which played a relatively limited role 
in Afghanistan under the former government, made some economic investments in Afghanistan 
(particularly in the development of Afghan minerals and other resources) prior to the Taliban 
takeover, but major projects have not come to fruition due to instability, lack of infrastructure, and 
other limitations.31 Despite concerns about Afghanistan-based Islamist terrorist groups, China has

signaled tacit acceptance of the Taliban’s rule, with its foreign minister emphasizing in a May 
2022 visit to Kabul that China “respects the independent choices made by the Afghan people.”32 

U.S. Policy Impacts of the Taliban’s Return to Power 
Renewed Taliban rule in Afghanistan has implications for a number of U.S. policy interests. It has 
created opportunities and challenges for the various terrorist groups that have a presence in 
Afghanistan, and has rendered obsolete former U.S. plans to partner with Afghan authorities to 
counter terrorist threats “over-the-horizon.” Advancing protection of women’s and other human 
rights has been another major U.S. policy goal in Afghanistan since 2001; the Taliban have taken 
numerous actions to roll back those rights since retaking power. U.S. policymakers, including 
many Members of Congress, have also focused on securing the relocation of remaining U.S. 
citizens and Afghans who previously worked for the U.S. government, a halting effort that 
remains ongoing as of November 2022.  

Counterterrorism  

A number of Islamist extremist terrorist groups have for decades operated in Afghanistan, and the 
Taliban have related to them in varying ways. ISKP and Al Qaeda (AQ) are two of the most 
significant of these terrorist groups, and the Taliban’s takeover has affected them differently.  

Long a significant U.S. counterterrorism concern, ISKP has clashed with the Taliban, as 
mentioned above. Under the former U.S.-backed Afghan government, the United States launched 
airstrikes in support of Taliban offensives against ISKP, a rare area of prior U.S.-Taliban 
cooperation.33 In February 2022, the U.S. State Department announced rewards of up to $10 
million each for information related to ISKP leader Sanaullah Ghafari as well as those responsible 
for the August 26, 2021, ISKP attack at Kabul airport that killed and injured hundreds of people, 
including over 30 U.S. service members.34  

While ISKP is seen as more operationally ambitious and capable in Afghanistan than Al Qaeda, 
the July 2022 killing of Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri in Kabul attracted considerable 
attention to the issue of AQ-Taliban ties.35 Despite (or perhaps because of) U.S. counterterrorism 
pressure, those ties have persisted for decades.36 The circumstances of Zawahiri’s residence in 
Kabul and what they might reveal about internal Taliban dynamics beyond continued AQ ties 
remain unclear. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has suggested that some elements of the 
Taliban might not have supported or even been aware of Zawahiri’s presence in Kabul, possibly 
leading to tensions within the movement.37  

In any case, per a July 2022 U.N. sanctions monitors report, Al Qaeda “is not viewed as posing an 
immediate international threat from its safe haven in Afghanistan because it lacks an external 
operational capability and does not currently wish to cause the Taliban international difficulty or

embarrassment.” 38 The U.S. intelligence community assessed in March 2022 that AQ “will gauge 
its ability to operate in Afghanistan under Taliban restrictions” as Al Qaeda and the Taliban 
recalibrate their relationship and activities.39  

From the outset of the U.S. withdrawal, U.S. officials said that the United States would maintain 
the ability to combat terrorist threats in Afghanistan such as ISKP and Al Qaeda without a 
military presence on the ground there by utilizing assets based outside of Afghanistan, in what 
U.S. officials describe as an “over-the-horizon” approach.40 With the Taliban in control of 
Afghanistan, the United States has had to alter any plans that had been predicated on the 
continued existence of the former Afghan government and its security forces. U.S. Central 
Command (CENTCOM) Commander General Michael Kurilla described over-the-horizon 
capabilities as “extremely difficult but not impossible” in February 2022 testimony.41 The Biden 
Administration has cited the Zawahiri strike as a demonstration of U.S. over-the-horizon

The Afghanistan in which the Taliban came to power in August 2021 was in many ways a 
different country than the one they last ruled in 2001. After 2001, women became active 
participants in many parts of Afghan society; protections for them, and ethnic and religious 
minorities, were enshrined in the country’s 2004 constitution. While some early Taliban actions 
suggested a possible measure of moderation from their highly oppressive 1996-2001 rule, UN 
High Commission for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said in June 2022 that “what we are 
witnessing in Afghanistan today is the institutionalized, systematic oppression of women” and 
that “Afghan women are rapidly facing the worst-case scenario many-feared.”43 

The Taliban takeover appears to have reduced high levels of violence that characterized the 
conflict, a development particularly welcomed by those in rural areas,44 but it has increased fears 
of many Afghans about repression and women’s rights.45 Systems formerly in place to support 
survivors of gender-based violence have been dismantled.46 The Taliban have closed the Ministry 
of Women’s Affairs, which had been a part of the former Afghan government, and have reinstated 
the Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which enforced the Taliban’s 
interpretation of Islam in the 1990s. The ministry has issued guidance that seeks to impose new 
restrictions on Afghan women, including by directing that women should not be allowed to travel

long distances without a male guardian and that male relatives of women who do not wear a hijab 
that fully covers their bodies should be punished.47  

Of particular concern to many U.S. policymakers are Taliban policies toward education for 
Afghan girls. Taliban spokespersons said in early 2022 that girls’ secondary schools, effectively 
shuttered in most of the country since the August 2021 takeover, would reopen with the start of 
the new school year in late March 2022.48 However, on March 23, with some girls already present 
in schools, the Taliban abruptly reversed course and announced that secondary schools for girls 
would remain closed, shocking many observers.49 The United States and many other countries 
condemned the decision, and in October 2022, the State Department announced visa restrictions 
on several Taliban figures responsible for the repression of women and girls in Afghanistan.50 

One analysis attributes the change to the advocacy of hardline clerics within the group and 
Akhundzada.51 Other Taliban figures, including both Baradar and the Haqqanis, reportedly 
support secondary education for girls (and some educate their own daughters abroad).52 The 
evidently greater influence of the group’s traditionally conservative leaders, and the 
unwillingness or inability of more pragmatic figures to assert themselves, suggests that external 
actors may have limited leverage over Taliban decisions.  

Ongoing Relocations of U.S. Citizens and Certain Afghans 

The Taliban’s entry into Kabul on August 15, 2021 triggered the mass evacuation of tens of 
thousands of U.S. citizens (including all diplomatic personnel), partner country citizens, and 
Afghans who worked for international efforts and/or the former Afghan government. U.S. 
officials say that U.S. military forces facilitated the evacuation of 124,000 individuals, including 
5,300 U.S. citizens, as part of Operation Allies Refuge, “the largest air evacuation in US 
history.”53 Since that operation ended on August 30, 2021, the State Department has said that it 
has assisted in the departure of 13,000 Afghans from the country, in addition to 800 U.S. citizens 
and 600 lawful permanent residents as of August 2022.54  

U.S. officials have characterized their efforts to secure the relocation of remaining U.S. citizens 
and eligible Afghan partners who seek to leave the country as an “enduring mission.”55 According 
to the State Department, the number of U.S. citizens it has identified in Afghanistan has 
fluctuated in the midst of continued relocations and because of cases in which additional U.S.

citizens come forward to ask for assistance to leave.56 On April 28, 2022, Secretary Antony 
Blinken said, “There are at present 126, as of a few days ago, American citizens remaining of 
whom 37 seek to leave and that we are assisting.”57 The number of Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) 
applicants, or those potentially eligible for an SIV or other forms of relief, who remain in 
Afghanistan is unclear. In a February 2022 report, an advocacy group for SIV-eligible persons 
stated that 78,000 of the estimated 81,000 SIV applicants in Afghanistan with visa applications 
pending as of August 15, 2021 remain in Afghanistan.58 The State Department has disputed the 
accuracy of this report.59 In May 2022, the State Department reportedly estimated that between 
70,000 and 160,000 Afghans were eligible for SIVs.60 

Some Afghans who seek to relocate reportedly remain in hiding, fearing Taliban retribution. The 
Taliban issued a general amnesty after coming to power, but, according to various accounts, the 
Taliban have carried out reprisals against figures aligned with the former government, including 
hundreds of killings.61 In April 2022, Secretary Blinken noted attacks by the Taliban against 
“those who are part of the former government,” adding that most appeared to be happening “at a 
local level” and were not “centrally directed.”62 

The Taliban have reportedly interfered with departure flights, including by demanding seats for 
Taliban-selected individuals to work abroad and remit money.63 Secretary Blinken said in late 
April 2022 that the Taliban had allowed freedom of movement to some degree but cautioned that 
there were still limited means of transportation to enable individuals to leave Afghanistan.64 The 
United States has reportedly paid, through Qatar, for tickets on some Afghan airlines that fly to 
Qatar for individuals to leave Afghanistan.65 Other impediments to relocations from Afghanistan 
includes logistical issues at Kabul’s international airport (see textbox) and issues with Afghans 
obtaining travel documentation.66 

Status of Kabul Airport 
Relocation efforts have been complicated by the status of Kabul’s international airport. After the final departure of 
U.S. forces, Qatar and Turkey worked to make the airport—which sustained damage to its runways, radar system, 
and other components during the U.S. evacuation effort and withdrawal—operational. As of November 2022,

some domestic and regional airlines are carrying out flights from Kabul airport, but major foreign carriers have yet 
to resume operations. Despite a preliminary December 2021 deal with Qatar and Turkey to operate several 
airports in Afghanistan, the Taliban in September 2022 announced that they had reached a seemingly similar deal 
with the United Arab Emirates to operate three airports, including Kabul’s.67 

Economic Collapse and Humanitarian Crisis 
The Taliban’s return to power has exacerbated one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world 
in Afghanistan, long one of the world’s poorest and most aid-dependent countries. A number of 
U.S. policy actions, including the cut-off of international development assistance, U.S. and 
international sanctions on the Taliban, and the U.S. hold on Afghanistan’s central bank assets, 
appear relevant to the economic breakdown that underlies the humanitarian crisis.  

The United States and other international donors provided billions of dollars a year to support the 
former Afghan government, financing over half of its $6 billion annual budget and as much as 
80% of total public expenditures.68 Much of that development assistance halted with the Taliban’s 
August 2021 takeover, leading the country’s economy to contract by over 20% in 2021.69 
International assistance is “expected to mitigate some negative impacts of the contraction,” 
according to the World Bank, but even that assistance “will not be sufficient to bring the economy 
back on a sustainable recovery path,” given the ongoing financial crisis, persistently high 
inflation, and Taliban policies.70  

The economic collapse has exacerbated what was already a severe humanitarian crisis in 
Afghanistan prior to August 2021, due primarily to conflict, drought, and the COVID-19 
pandemic. Indicators suggest that conditions have worsened further since August 2021: the World 
Food Programme asserted in November 2022 that “Afghanistan continues to face the highest 
prevalence of insufficient food consumption globally,” with 90% of Afghans reporting not having 
enough to eat.71 The U.N. Special Representative for Afghanistan said in March 2022 that due to 
emergency assistance from international donors, “we have perhaps averted our worst fears of 
famine and widespread starvation” for the winter of 2021-2022.72 The winter of 2022-2023 may 
be more difficult yet, given increased food prices.73 In November 2022, the U.N. Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF) estimated that 1.1 million Afghan children are expected to need treatment for severe 
acute malnutrition.74

Afghanistan: Background and U.S. Policy in Brief 

U.S. Policy Responses 

The United States has provided over $1.1 billion million in humanitarian assistance in 
Afghanistan and neighboring countries since the Taliban takeover.75 While such assistance plays a 
crucial role in averting further humanitarian suffering, it is different in many ways from former 
U.S. security, development, and stabilization assistance, which averaged over $5 billion annually 
between FY2019 and FY2021. In addition to providing some humanitarian assistance, those 
funds paid the salaries of Afghan soldiers and civil servants, supported key government services, 
and ultimately made up a large portion of Afghanistan’s economy. The Biden Administration’s 
FY2023 budget request proposes $345 million for health, education, and other forms of assistance 
in Afghanistan; the lack of a U.S. diplomatic presence in Afghanistan may complicate or 
constrain the implementation and/or oversight of U.S. funding. 

Beyond assistance, the two U.S. policy areas that appear to have the greatest relevance to the 
economic and humanitarian situation are sanctions and the ongoing U.S. hold on Afghanistan’s 
central bank reserves. U.S. sanctions on the Taliban (in place in various forms since 1999) 
remain, but it is unclear to what extent they are affecting humanitarian conditions in 
Afghanistan.76 Since the Taliban’s takeover, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has issued 
several general licenses stating that U.S. sanctions on the Taliban do not prohibit the provision of 
assistance to Afghanistan and authorizing various humanitarian and commercial transactions.77 
Still, the continued existence of sanctions might lead financial institutions or other actors to “de-
risk” Afghanistan by refusing to engage in the country rather than risk violation of U.S. sanctions. 
For more on U.S. sanctions on the Taliban, see CRS In Focus IF12039, Afghanistan: 
Humanitarian Crisis, Economic Collapse, and U.S. Sanctions. 

The Biden Administration’s hold on U.S.-based Afghan central bank assets has also drawn 
scrutiny. Imposed days after the Taliban entered Kabul to prevent the Taliban from accessing the 
funds, the Taliban and some foreign leaders have urged the United States to release the hold on 
those assets, which total around $7 billion.78 On February 11, 2022, the Biden Administration 
announced that it would “seek to facilitate access of $3.5 billion [of the assets] ... for the benefit 
of the Afghan people,” pending ongoing litigation related to the September 11, 2001, attacks.79 In 
September 2022, the Administration announced the establishment of an “Afghan Fund” (based in 
Switzerland) to “make targeted disbursements of that $3.5 billion to help provide greater stability 
to the Afghan economy.”80 The Fund’s board met for the first time in November 2022.81 

Congressional Action and Outlook 
The Taliban’s takeover attracted intense congressional and public scrutiny. U.S. public attention 
appears to have decreased in the subsequent months, but Afghanistan remains the subject of

congressional engagement as some Members seek to account for the evident failure of U.S. 
efforts and grapple with the reality of the Taliban’s renewed rule.82 

Congressional oversight of Afghanistan has been robust. Congressional committees held at least 
ten hearings specifically on Afghanistan in the weeks after the Taliban’s takeover.83 Senate 
Foreign Relations minority staff released an assessment of the August 2021 evacuation in 
February 2022, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member produced an interim 
report on the withdrawal in August 2022.84 In addition, Congress established the Afghanistan War 
Commission (AWC, Section 1094 of the FY2022 National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, 
P.L. 117-81) charged with examining the war and developing “a series of lessons learned and 
recommendations for the way forward” in a final report to be issued within three years.  

Congress has also increased reporting requirements related to Afghanistan. In the FY2022 
NDAA, Congress directed the Administration to submit reports covering a number of topics, 
including U.S. over-the horizon counterterrorism capabilities; the status of U.S.-supplied military 
materiel in Afghanistan; and the lessons of Afghanistan for other U.S. security cooperation 
programs. Reports required in the House-passed FY2023 NDAA (H.R. 7900) include a strategy 
for reimbursing U.S. personnel who expended personal funds in support of evacuation efforts and 
an assessment of China’s activities in Afghanistan. The bill would also mandate an interagency 
inspector general review of efforts to support and process evacuees from Afghanistan, including 
screening procedures, and a full accounting of the number of individuals evacuated in 2021 
disaggregated by age, SIV eligibility, and other categories.  

In shaping U.S. policy toward Afghanistan, Congress may consider a number of policy options, 
including 

  Congress may examine how U.S. assistance, and conditions thereon, may affect 

Taliban actions, including with regard to women’s rights more broadly and the 
ability of Afghan girls to attend secondary schools in particular, to inform 
congressional consideration of the Administration’s budget request and action on 
FY2023 appropriations; 

  Congress may request or mandate additional information from the Administration 
about the number and status of U.S. citizens and Afghan partners who remain in 
Afghanistan and about the status of U.S. efforts to secure their relocation, 
including resources devoted to those efforts, obstacles to further relocations, and 
Administration plans to overcome those obstacles;

Afghanistan: Background and U.S. Policy in Brief 

  Congress may examine the impact of U.S. sanctions on the targeted individuals, 
the Afghan economy, and Afghan society more broadly, including by requiring 
reporting thereon from the Administration and/or the Government Accountability 
Office, to assess whether they are achieving their intended objectives; and 
  Congress may examine the impact and efficacy of oversight of previous U.S. 

efforts in Afghanistan to shape future U.S. policy efforts (e.g., H.R. 8560, 117th 
Congress), congressional authorizing and appropriations measures, and oversight 
mechanisms (including those intended to oversee U.S. assistance to other foreign 
partners, such as Ukraine). Relevant reports from the AWC and the Department 
of Defense (and the federally funded research and development center with 
whom the Department contracts, as directed by Section 1323 of P.L. 117-81) are 
due to be submitted within approximately one and two years, respectively. 

Going forward, U.S. policy, including congressional action, will be influenced and likely 
constrained by a number of factors, including 

 

 

a dearth of information about dynamics in Afghanistan, given the lack of U.S. 
diplomats and other on the ground observers and Taliban-imposed limitations on 
journalists; and 

the historical legacy of U.S. conflict with the Taliban, which may make 
cooperation with the group, even to advance U.S. policy priorities, politically 
difficult. 

Perhaps more fundamental is the challenge of how to pursue U.S. policy priorities that may be 
difficult to reconcile: stabilizing Afghanistan and providing support to Afghans while avoiding 
actions that might benefit the Taliban. While providing humanitarian aid may be sufficient to 
stave off mass casualties, it is unlikely to sustainably improve economic conditions. Financial 
assistance could improve the Afghan economy, ameliorating the humanitarian situation, but 
comes with the risk of diversion of some funds or broader benefits to the Taliban. In considering 
Administration budget requests, Members of Congress may weigh these and other options, 
including conditions on U.S. assistance. 

The Taliban have called for international recognition, assistance, and sanctions relief, but since 
returning to power they have not shown a willingness to make compromises on important issues 
to obtain them. Nearly every country, U.S. partners and adversaries alike, has urged the Taliban to 
form a more inclusive government, and many countries have joined the United States in calling 
for the group to lift restrictions on women and girls and break ties with terrorist groups. In 
response, the Taliban have stalled, equivocated, and ultimately either ignored or rejected outright 
these calls. Foreign policy tools that the United States has traditionally used as leverage may not 
be as effective in Afghanistan as in some other contexts.85
